# ilacrehberim

Ilac Rehberim is an iOS application that was built as a part of my IB Diploma Program Computer Science course.
It is an app for tracking medications for people who'd like to recieve notifications about when they need to
take their medications according to their schedules. It has user sign in system, which allows medication schedules
to be accessible from other devices when the user signs in from another device. To do so, all the data
is stored on an online database, using the free service offered by Google Firebase.

The app is targeted towards Turkish users, so all the text is in Turkish.
